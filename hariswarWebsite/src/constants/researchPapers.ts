    title: "The Progression of Home Console Operating Systems",
    description: "We researched the usage of different Operating Systems for different console game companies. With every new console generation comes the debate of which game console is the “best”. Rather than using subjective and biased opinions, we aim to explore and uncover what difference in their operating system sets them apart. We will be comparing the performance, memory management, and scheduling of each console’s Operating System. From these parts, we hope to find the reason for each console's performance and how these decisions impact the overall system performance and user satisfaction. Operating systems (OSs) serve the critical role of connecting the hardware and software of a device. As the hardware continues to improve and the needs of the software continue to rise, OSs must improve to meet these needs. The gaming industry serves as an interesting microcosm of this three-way race. By researching the three major gaming companies, Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, we can analyze how the progression of hardware and each company's goals impacted the OSs they designed. We found that Sony built its OSs with an emphasis on maximum performance, Microsoft built theirs off of Windows for both compatibility and ease of implementation, and Nintendo built theirs to be as minimal as possible to support cheaper and more accessible hardware.",

    title: "Analyzing the Toxicity Dataset",
    description: "Chemicals can have adverse effects on aquatic systems. A type of water flea (Daphnia magna) are often used to assess the aquatic toxicity of chemicals. The concentration of the chemical that causes death in 50% of D. magna over a duration of 48 hours is referred to as LC50. In this dataset, 350 chemicals were tested for toxicity toward D. magna and information was obtained on various properties of the chemical (called molecular descriptors). It is of interest to predict the aquatic toxicity toward D. magna by using the molecular descriptors of the chemicals. All of our 8 predictors are quantitative variable types. Our goal of this analysis and report is to predict the concentration of a given chemical that will kill 50% of the water fleas (Daphnia magna) based on molecular descriptors of the chemicals and be able to know which chemicals are more toxic to Daphnia magna than others solely based on the molecular descriptors of the chemicals. We opted to use 7 distinct statistical learning methods to this task of predicting toxicity values based on the molecular descriptors of a chemical. These methods include: Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Term Model, Best Subsets Model, Interaction Term Model, Lasso Regression, Principal Component Regression, Partial Least Squares Regression.",

    fullContent: "Analysis of the Effect of Ball Type and Drop Height on Maximum Rebound Height\nBy: Hariswar Baburaj, Joshua Purvis, Parham Keshavarzi, Karthik Thota\n\nIntroduction\nWe did an experiment in order to see if the ball type and drop height affect the maximum rebound height. In order to complete this experiment successfully, we set up a meter stick against the wall and secured it. Then we followed a randomized trial order and dropped specific balls from specific heights. When the drop occurs, we made sure to record the drop and rebound height in slow motion. Finally, we noted down the maximum rebound height in an excel sheet based on the resulting video. Based on the results we got, we made a Two-way ANOVA model and performed Tukey-adjusted pairwise comparisons.\n\nExperimental Design\nFor our experiment, the response variable was the maximum rebound height of the ball (cm). We had 2 factors which were the ball type and drop height with 3 levels in each of them.\nBall Type (Factor 1)                  Drop Height (Factor 2)\nLevel 1: Tennis Ball                 Level 1: 50 cm\nLevel 2: Golf Ball                   Level 2: 75 cm\nLevel 3: Ping Pong Ball              Level 3: 100 cm\n\nTreatment Combinations:\nTennis Ball with 50 cm drop\nTennis Ball with 75 cm drop\nTennis Ball with 100 cm drop\nGolf Ball with 50 cm drop\nGolf Ball with 75 cm drop\nGolf Ball with 100 cm drop\nPing Pong Ball with 50 cm drop\nPing Pong Ball with 75 cm drop\nPing Pong Ball with 100 cm drop\n\nOur controlled variables were hard tile floor, measurement method, instrument, room conditions, ball releaser, ball condition and the testing day. Our experimental and observational unit is each individual ball drop. We had 4 replicates per treatment combination with 36 total number of trials. For our randomization, we randomized the order of trials in R and our tests were conducted in the specified order.\n\nStatistical Methods\nThe statistical model is a Two-Way ANOVA in the form:\nWhat each of the terms in the model mean:\n\nThe assumptions for this model are:\nThe errors are normal, independent with constant variance.\n\nThe constraints for this model are:\nThis is required to keep the model from being over-parameterized.\n\nData Analysis Process: First, rebound height data were collected for each trial of the experiment. A Two-Way ANOVA model including the interaction between ball type and drop height was then fitted using R. A Global F-test was conducted to assess the significance of the interaction effect. If the interaction was not statistically significant, the main effects of ball type and drop height were tested. Tukey-adjusted pairwise comparisons were used to find specific differences among our treatment levels. Throughout our analysis, we used a significance level of α = 0.05.\n\nResults\nBefore testing the factorial effects, the assumptions underlying the two-way ANOVA were first evaluated. Specifically, residual diagnostics from the fitted model were examined using a Normal Q–Q plot to assess normality and a Residuals versus Fitted Values plot to assess constant variance, as shown in Fig. 1a and b. Overall, the residuals closely followed the reference line in the Q–Q plot, indicating approximate normality. In addition, the residuals were randomly scattered around zero in the residuals versus fitted plot, with no apparent pattern or funnel shape. Consequently, the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were considered reasonable, and no data transformation or corrective action was required.\nFig 1: Residual diagnostics for the two-way ANOVA: (a) Residuals vs fitted values and (b) Normal Q–Q plot.\n\nFurthermore, the experimental design was balanced, consisting of three ball types and three drop heights with four replicates per treatment combination, resulting in a total sample size of n = 36. This balanced structure supports the robustness of the ANOVA results.\n\nTwo-way ANOVA and interaction effects\nAfter verifying the model assumptions, a Type I (sequential) two-way ANOVA was conducted to examine the effects of ball type, drop height, and their interaction on maximum rebound height at a significance level of α = 0.05. The ANOVA results are summarized in Table 1.\n\nHere is the hypothesis for interaction:\nH0: (αβ)ij = 0 for all i,j\nHa: (αβ)ij ≠ 0 for at least one pair (i,j)\n\nTable 1: Type I two-way ANOVA results for rebound height.\n\nSince the interaction between ball type and drop height was statistically significant, F(4, 27) = 17.44, p = 3.52 × 10^-7 < 0.05. As a result, the null hypothesis was rejected, demonstrating that the effect of drop height on rebound height depends on the type of ball.\n\nThis interaction is further supported by the interaction plot shown in Fig. 2. In this plot, the mean rebound-height lines across drop heights are non-parallel for different ball types, visually confirming that the relationship between drop height and rebound height varies among balls. Therefore, both factors jointly influence rebound behavior.\n\nFig 2: Interaction plot of mean rebound height versus drop height for each ball type.\n\nTukey-adjusted pairwise comparisons\nFollowing the significant Ball Type × Drop Height interaction observed in the two-way ANOVA, Tukey-adjusted pairwise comparisons were conducted within each drop height to examine differences among ball types while controlling the family-wise error rate at α = 0.05. The results of these comparisons are presented in Table 2 and are interpreted separately for each drop height.\n\nAt a drop height of 50 cm, none of the pairwise comparisons among golf, ping pong, and tennis balls were statistically significant (all adjusted p-values > 0.05). This indicates that, at the lowest drop height, rebound heights did not differ significantly across ball types.\n\nAt a drop height of 75 cm, statistically significant differences were observed among all ball types. Ping pong balls rebounded significantly higher than golf balls (difference = 6.25 cm, p < 0.0001) and tennis balls (difference = 9.50 cm, p < 0.0001). In addition, golf balls rebounded significantly higher than tennis balls (difference = 3.25 cm, p = 0.0078). These results indicate a clear ordering of rebound performance at 75 cm, with ping pong balls exhibiting the highest rebound, followed by golf balls, and then tennis balls.\n\nAt a drop height of 100 cm, golf balls rebounded significantly higher than both ping pong balls (difference = 4.00 cm, p = 0.0011) and tennis balls (difference = 4.50 cm, p = 0.0003). However, no statistically significant difference was observed between ping pong and tennis balls at this height (difference = 0.50 cm, p = 0.8697). This suggests that, at the highest drop height, golf balls exhibit superior rebound performance, while ping pong and tennis balls behave similarly.\n\nOverall, these height-specific Tukey comparisons further confirm the presence of a significant interaction effect. Specifically, the relative rebound performance of the ball types changes with drop height, demonstrating that the effect of ball type on rebound height depends strongly on the drop height.\n\nTable 2: Tukey-adjusted pairwise comparisons of ball types within each drop height.\n\nConclusion\nBased on the results, drop height significantly affects the rebound height for all ball types. Higher drops produced higher rebounds. The ball type also affected the rebound height where the effect depends on the drop height (significant interaction). A challenge we had while conducting this experiment was the room lighting in the room we did the experiment making the video a bit unclear and so we addressed this by using a phone flashlight to illuminate the trial area. Another challenge we had while conducting this experiment was having consistent ball drops so we addressed this by making sure to practice the procedure before running the trials and also by having the same person release the ball in all of the trials. Some potential improvements were to use a non-human mechanism to perfectly drop the ball and not have human error, a fixed stand to hold the recording device to ensure consistent readings and not have human error, and also just add more replicates per treatment.",

    fullContent: "Introduction:\nIn our daily life, we have been using all sorts of products throughout the day and the main one is watches. Especially, when the technology has been developing and the number of smartwatches being bought and created is also skyrocketing. According to Boettcher, watches were first introduced in Europe during the thirteenth century named Mechanical Clock [1]. As the world evolved with technologies, the watches also made their evolution from being mechanical to smartwatches. In the early ages, the usage of watches was just for checking time but time has evolved now. There are so many features being added using advanced technology, microcontrollers and other mechanisms in order to develop unique components such as heart rate check and monitoring human health. In order to successfully implement watches like Apple, Fitbit and Samsung Galaxy, we need the services of microcontrollers which play a major role in managing sensors like the heart rate, batteries and monitoring time. In this paper, we will be discussing the types of microcontrollers being used in smartwatches such as Apple, Fitbit and Samsung Galaxy. We will go through their purpose, performance, and the impact microcontrollers have in smart watches and how they play a major role in introducing successful smartwatches to society.\n\nSummary of References:\nApple:\nApple is one of the biggest global market companies and has been involved in developing all sorts of technologies such as Iphones, Macbook and watches. Apple started to reveal their ideas and watch products to the world in early 2015 with showing their first ever apple watch. In order to implement the Apple Watch successfully, the company needed the services of a microcontroller in order to create unique and better features. Apple utilizes the ST32 microcontroller in order to control sensors and other features including batteries and interactive displays in smartwatches [2]. Basically, microcontrollers help to read data and information from sensors and send them directly to the processor which makes signals and gives the connection to the heart rate when it's being connected to the humans. So for example, when we run or exercise the microcontroller stored inside the apple watch collects the data from our movement and utilizes it to determine accurate results such as the amount of calories burned by us and the exact heart rate for that specific time. So, without a microcontroller, the Apple watch won’t be able to track our health and won’t have any interaction features in them which is essential and needed for companies in order to make the watches unique from their competitors.\n\nFitbit:\nFitbit is a modern watch which is primarily used to monitor things related to health which includes the heart rate, amount of walking steps per day and other fitness related activities. In order to implement fitbit, it is being created with ST Microelectronics STM32L151C6 microcontrollers which is technically an 32-bit microcontroller with an important mechanism of ARM cortex - M3 core imported in the fitbit [3]. There are key main services that would be impacted if there is not a quality microcontroller which are the sensors, batter power and bluetooth radio. Sensors are a really key feature in smartwatches such as fitbit since it really helps the person wearing it to track their heart rates and the amount of steps. Microcontrollers also help to save the power of the battery that is being used by the buyers and provide them a quality battery life rather than getting damaged in the early stages. In terms of bluetooth, they utilize the microcontroller in order to communicate with the Fitbit app and make sure the battery doesn’t drain quickly. So overall, the microcontroller in fitbit plays an important role in keeping the fitbit watch secure and maintained properly which provides a quality service for customers that are purchasing fitbit.\n\nSamsung Galaxy:\nSamsung is also one of the largest global market companies and the major competitor of Apple in all sorts of technologies. They both are the competitors for phones, laptops, computers, tabs and smartwatches. In terms of the smartwatches, Samsung uses Samsung Exynos multiprocessors which helps them with Wifi, location and bluetooth. So the smartwatches don't need that much power compared to other technologies that Samsung makes. So the Exynos processor plays a huge part in terms of graphic processing with the 64 bit multicore CPU in order to have better performance and be efficient [4]. It is also similar to other companies where the multiprocessor helps them with tracking heart rate and sleep monitoring. It also enhances the user's experience with calls, texts, bluetooth connections and more in order to keep the buyers engaged while using the Samsung smartwatch. Samsung is also using advanced and more powerful multiprocessors in latest generation smartwatches and planning to use them in the upcoming ones as well. The features they are planning to add on is that the users can access applications through visual interfaces and keep them engaged. Overall, Samsung also uses powerful multiprocessors in order to give one of the best experiences for the users of Samsung galaxy smartwatch.\n\nDiscussion:\nSmartwatches have been a regular usage for most people in this era which helps them save time in regard to checking their health, where you get an instant update on your heart rate, and steps check. Specifically, In my daily life the existence of microcontrollers in smartwatches plays a massive role since it checks health, helps me to manage my time well and efficiently. With regard to the importance of microcontrollers, it’s the device that works behind the display in order to track my heart rate and step count with a sensor when I go swimming or go for a run in the evening. It keeps me actively engaged and also provides me some motivation to be disciplined and follow a healthy life. Overall, microcontrollers are really important for me, especially in smartwatches in order to keep me active, engaged and in a healthy lifestyle.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, microcontrollers play a very important role in the field of smartwatches now and also in the future as technology advances to another level. Without quality microcontrollers, smartwatches won’t be able to track sensors accurately which includes heart rates, sleep patterns and might have problems with battery draining so fast. They behave like the brain of smartwatches which connects to many other parts and gives energy in order to keep them active. Overall, microcontrollers enable smartwatches to work efficiently and accurately in order to satisfy the buyers expectations from the smart watches.",
